# Basic Python Project

## Overview

This project is a basic Python application designed to provide a template for building Python-based projects. It includes essential configurations for code linting, testing, and dependency management. The repository is structured to facilitate easy project setup and maintain good coding practices.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- `pip` (Python package installer)
- `virtualenv` (optional but recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BasicPythonProject.git
   cd BasicPythonProject
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Application

To run the main application script:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

### Running Tests

This project uses `pytest` for testing. To run tests:

```bash
pip install -r tests/requirements.txt  # Install test dependencies (together with pytest!)
pytest
```

## Code Quality and Linting

- **Pylint** and **Flake8** are used for code linting. Configuration files are provided (`.pylintrc` and `.flake8`).
- **Mypy** is used for static type checking.

To run linters manually:

```bash
pylint src/
flake8 src/
mypy src/
```

## Continuous Integration

The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/lint-code.yml`) to automatically lint code on every push or pull request.
